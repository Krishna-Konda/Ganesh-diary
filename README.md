# 🥛 Shri Ganesh Milk Center – My First React App

This is my first **React project**, made for my own dairy business **Shri Ganesh Milk Center (Ganesh Diary)**.  
It shows daily milk prices (bhav), lists products, and has a live milk calculator that updates automatically when the bhav changes.  
I built it while learning React, Bootstrap, and JavaScript step by step.
