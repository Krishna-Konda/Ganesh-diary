# Ganesh Diary 🥛

My first React project built for my dairy business **Shri Ganesh Milk Center**.

This website shows:

- Daily milk bhav (price per liter)
- Product listings
- A live milk calculator that updates automatically when the bhav changes

Built while learning **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **React Hooks** step by step.  
This project is created for real business use and learning purposes.
